## What is TailwindCSS?

It is a low-level, highly customizable framework that provides us with a large number of utility classes that we can use in our HTML to perform any styling and/or animation we want without interfering with your own CSS.

<div class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 rounded-md overflow-hidden">
  <iframe
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
    class="rounded-md"
    frameborder="0"
    height="480"
    loading="lazy"

    width="640"
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Initialize the project 🎉

What we will do is to start a `create-react-app` project from scratch with the following commands:

```bash
# npm
npx create-react-app tailwind-cra

# yarn
yarn create react-app tailwind-cra
```

➡️ After the project has been configured we will enter the folder:

```bash
cd tailwind-cra
```

📦 And now let's proceed to install TailwindCSS in our project:

```bash
# npm
npm i tailwindcss

# yarn
yarn add tailwindcss
```

⚙ Now let's configure our scripts to run Tailwind:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:tailwind": "tailwindcss build src/tailwind.css -o src/tailwind.output.css",
  "prestart": "npm run build:tailwind",
  "prebuild": "npm run build:tailwind",
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

The `build:tailwind` script will compile our `src/tailwind.css` file and generate a `src/tailwind.output.css` file (we will use it later to import it into our application).

⚠️ _**Note:**_ lthe generation of `src/tailwind.css` will only be done once each time we run a script, if we want to edit our own site styles it is better to use a separate `.css` or `.scss`.

### Let's configure our styles

Let's configure our styles

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Now we are going to edit our `App.js` and we will put the following code:

```jsx
// Dependencies
import React from 'react';

// Styles
import './tailwind.output.css';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-500">
      <h2 className="text-center text-4xl font-bold text-blue-900">
        TailwindCSS + React
      </h2>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Now that we have everything ready we only have to start our application with:

```bash
# npm
npm run start

# yarn
yarn start
```

This script will take care of generating our `tailwind.output.css` file inside `src` and after that it will build our application, which should look something like this

<CodeSandbox codeSandboxId="tailwindcss-cra-16efl" />

🎉 Done! We have our application made with `create-react-app` together with Tailwind to be able to style it.

### Recomendaciones

Do not make changes to `tailwind.output.css` as each time the script is run your changes will be overwritten by running either `start` or `build`. Instead we should put our changes in `src/tailwind.css` and restart the script each time we make a change. (I recommend making a separate file to handle styles and not using `tailwind.css`).

❕ _**Important:**_ we must add `tailwind.output.css` to our `.gitignore` to avoid committing it to GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket as this file will be generated before running either `start` or `build`.

## Preparing for production 🚀 and a surprise 🤩

Now we are going to install two dependencies that we are going to need:

```bash
# npm
npm i npm-run-all chokidar-cli

# yarn
yarn add npm-run-all chokidar-cli
```

- `npm run all` is an npm package to run several scripts at the same time.
- `chokidar-cli` is a package that allows us to see changes in any file we specify in our project.

Now we are going to change our scripts in the `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:tailwind": "tailwind build src/tailwind.css -o src/tailwind.output.css",
  "watch:tailwind": "chokidar 'src/**/*.css' 'src/**/*.scss' --ignore src/tailwind.output.css -c 'npm run build:tailwind'",

  "start": "npm-run-all build:tailwind --parallel watch:tailwind start:react",
  "start:react": "react-scripts start",

  "prebuild": "run-s build:tailwind",

  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
},
```

🎉 **Surprise!** you will notice that we have added a script called `watch:tailwind`, this script will serve to make a new build every time the css changes, ignoring `tailwind.output.css` so we avoid having infinite build loops.

### TailwindCSS configuration file

In the root of our project we are going to create a `tailwind.config.js` file with this code:

```js
module.exports = {
  purge: [
    'src/**/*.js',
    'src/**/*.jsx',
    'src/**/*.ts',
    'src/**/*.tsx',
    'public/**/*.html',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
};
```

One of the most fascinating features is that we can tell Tailwind where are the files that have your classes and so it does a cleanup in `build` to remove classes that we are not using and we have a file with a minimum weight in our final `.css`.

## Conclusions ✨

In this blogpost we learned how to perform a configuration for our React application created through CRA and we could also see how to perform realtime watch of our `.css` files to detect any changes we have 🙌.

If you want to know how to customize Tailwind classes you can go to [this documentation link](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/theme) to learn more about what directives we can modify and extend, now, with nothing more to add.
