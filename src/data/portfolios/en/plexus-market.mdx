## What is Plexus Market?

Plexus Market is a cloud-based custom dynamic video rendering platform that can be used to hyper-target your audience with individualized content at scale. It's a cost-effective solution to help move your next campaign forward, drive your next story or push your next big idea.

## What problem was solved?

Previously Plexus used a contact form to sell their products, although it was all automated it was not very intuitive with the customer. A virtual platform/shop was built to show the company's information, all the services offered and to be able to buy the products directly on the website.
