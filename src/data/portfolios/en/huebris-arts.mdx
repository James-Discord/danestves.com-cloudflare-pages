## What is Huebris Arts?

> Since I was a child, I have been drawing, painting, taking pictures and creating things. I continue this childhood passion with the goal of expressing the ideas, opinions and feelings I have. I call myself "Huebris" as an artist because I identify with the concept of "hubris" from Greek tragedies; a character flaw marked by excessive pride that leads the hero to his ultimate demise.

## What problem was solved?

Lauren Rust is an emerging artist who wanted to showcase her paintings on a website so that potential customers could also purchase them through the site.
