## What is Codesign International?

Codesign is an agency that aims to help the South American workforce connect with the 715 billion freelance market by providing them with essential tools and courses. In this way, they create an alternative way for people to escape the traditional labor market and promote economic inclusion in the region.

> Codesign's duty is to lower the entry barrier by offering free courses and business advice to those selected. Those who complete the courses will be certified and signed by some of our core team members.

## What problem was solved?

Codesign International is a company that offers free training to Latin Americans to enter the working world with better knowledge and a good resume. This project was conceived as a bridge between the freelance market and the South American public. Specifically, they focused on the Venezuelan market because it is the country that needs the most help in terms of education.
