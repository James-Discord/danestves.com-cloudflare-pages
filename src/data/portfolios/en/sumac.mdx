## What problem was solved?

This restaurant needed an easier way to consult their menu without wasting paper, and offer customers a more intuitive way. The site was built in such a way that when they consult the menu they can see what the dish is made up of and what the price is. In this way, the restaurant can serve both the physical tables and the customers who order from their homes much faster.
