      "Since I was a child I have been interested in computers starting from video games, every time I played I felt a need to know how it is working and how my character makes any movement",
      "When I got to high school I started researching computers and became interested in how websites are built on top of all the social networks, I liked the idea that when a user selected a menu it showed more options and animations, and that&apos;s what made me fall in love with web development.",
      "I started from the age of sixteen to work and learn from the frontend, the visual part of the web; today I consider myself a fullstack because thanks to the knowledge I have acquired I can build applications from views to databases and routes. I like to learn more every day, integrate new technologies and contribute to new projects to improve productivity."
